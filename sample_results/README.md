# Sample results

This directory contains `.zip` files with results of the `gramine-tdx` benchmarks for different versions at different points in time.

Each zip contains a `README` on how to reproduce the respective plots.

It also has additional notes, wherever required.

Currently we have the following two result sets:
1. `ccs_shepherding_results.zip`: the results of `gramine-tdx` ACM CCS revised submission
2. `candle_32_fix_results.zip`: the results of `gramine-tdx` after the performance fix for the `candle` benchmark for 32 threads
